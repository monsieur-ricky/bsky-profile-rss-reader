# BlueSky Profile RSS Reader

BlueSky Profile RSS Reader is a library designed to fetch and display RSS feeds from BlueSky profiles. It allows users to enter a BlueSky profile and view their updates in a consolidated feed.
This project focuses on using modern Angular practices and **not relying on Zone.js or RxJS**.

## Key Features:
- Load BlueSky post from a given profile handle or id.
- Show selected profile description.
- Zone.js-Free Angular: Demonstrates the use of Angular without Zone.js using only Signals.
- No use of RxJS relying only on the new `resource` API for asynchronous requests.
- All styles were created with Tailwind CSS.
